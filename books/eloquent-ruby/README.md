# #xxx Eloquent Ruby

Book notes - Eloquent Ruby, by Russ Olsen.
First published January 27, 2011. Second Edition currently in beta - due Q1 2026.

## Notes

This was the book that finally helped me crack the core concepts of lambdas, meta-programming and DSLs.

The first edition is showing its age now - written in the ruby 1.9 era, but a new Second Edition is on the way, due later in 2026.
