# #378 Seven Languages in Seven Weeks

Book notes - Seven Languages in Seven Weeks: A Pragmatic Guide to Learning Programming Languages, by Bruce A. Tate. First published November 17, 2010.

## Notes

The classic by Bruce Tate. In the early 2000's there was distinct interest in rejecting the idea of a monoculture
.. perhaps on the back of the 90's battles between Microsoft with VB vs. IBM Java trying to convince everyone that there could only be one answer.
It was an enlightened era, where perhaps we would be better served by selecting the language to best suit each specific situation,
rather than choosing one language and trying to use it everywhere.

"Seven Languages in Seven Weeks" aimed to introduce a range of languages:
more than just a "Hello World" in each language; enough to get the true flavor of the language.
