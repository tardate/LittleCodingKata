# #006 Rust/about

Is it a joke, or does everyone seem to have "rust" in mind these days?

Somehow it got voted
[the most "loved" language](http://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2016#technology-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted)
in the 2016 stackoverflow survey.
Yet is still missing from the "top", "trending" or "popular" lists.

## Rust In a Nutshell

Rust is...

* designed to be memory safe, and it does not permit null pointers or dangling pointers
* free and open source - dual-licensed under Apache 2.0 and MIT

Rust has..

* an object system based around implementations, traits and structured types
* ad-hoc polymorphism
* strong typing
* a reputation for introducing breaking changes and poor documentation

Rust is governed by..

* [a core team](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-wiki-backup/blob/master/Note-core-team.md)
* [an RFC process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#what-the-process-is)
* under an [open governance process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1068-rust-governance.md)

Rust implementations..

* a single compiler implementation, written in Rust though originally bootstrapped with [OCaml](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6932601)
* the first "stable" version of the Rust, version 1.0.0, was released in May 2015

The Rust ecosystem includes:

* Cargo - dependency manager and build tool
* Rustfmt - coding style enforcement
* The Rust Language Server -  IDE integration for code completion and inline error messages

## Why Rust?

The goal of Rust is to be a good language for creating highly concurrent and highly safe systems.

Rust solves the three big problems of C/C++ without introducing garbage collection or extensive run-time processing:

* agreement on memory allocation size
* agreement on memory ownership and de-allocation
* agreement on concurrent memory access
