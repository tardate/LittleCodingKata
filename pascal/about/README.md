Pascal In a Nutshell

## Notes

I haven't written or used any [Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(programming_language)) code for decades.
But it was my first love when it comes to computer languages.
It's where I first learned structured and object-oriented programming techniques.
I'm curious about the state of Pascal. Does anyone still use it much? CAN you even use it on modern machines?

Pascal:

* was designed by Niklaus Wirth, first appeared around 1970
* uses static, strong, safe typing
* influenced by ALGOL W, Simula 67

It has existed under various standards and implementations:

* Niklaus Wirth's 1974 version of the language - the "standard"
* ISO/IEC 7185:1990 Pascal. First created in 1983, mainframe and minicomputer implementations generally followed the standard. PC versions did not!
* ISO/IEC 10206:1990 Extended Pascal
* Borland standards Turbo Pascal and Delphi
* UCSD Pascal, later adopted as Apple Pascal

### Installing a Compiler

First step is obviously just to try and get it installed...

[Free Pascal](https://www.freepascal.org/) appears to be one of the more actively maintained
implementations.
I've successfully got it [running on MacOS - see here](../free_pascal).

NB: [GNU Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Pascal) was a thing for a while, but the
[official release](http://www.gnu-pascal.de/gpc/h-index.html) died around 2006, and
[Mac ports by Microbizz](http://www.microbizz.nl/gpc.html) supports only up to Mac OSX 10.6.
