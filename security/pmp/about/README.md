### Linux Installation Notes

I'm testing with a trial installation on Ubuntu 22.04.1.

Basic installation steps,
as covered in
[Installing Password Manager Pro - Linux](https://www.manageengine.com/products/passwordmanagerpro/help/installation.html#inst-lin):

Download and execute (this is the command line installer):

    chmod u+x ManageEngine_PMP_64bit.bin
    ./ManageEngine_PMP_64bit.bin -i console

Installation options:

* Default Install Folder: $HOME/ManageEngine/PMP
* High Availability Primary Server

After installer has completed, configure the system service:

    $ cd $HOME/ManageEngine/PMP/bin
    $ sudo bash pmp.sh install
    Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/pmp.service â†’ /etc/systemd/system/pmp.service.
    Password Manager Pro Service installed successfully !

I have UFW enabled. Add the default port to allow external access:

    $ sudo ufw allow 7272
    Rule added
    Rule added (v6)
    $ sudo ufw status
    Status: active

    To                         Action      From
    --                         ------      ----
    ...
    7272                       ALLOW       Anywhere
    ...
    7272 (v6)                  ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)
    ...

Start the PMP service:

    sudo systemctl start pmp.service

load the web console on `https:///<pmp-host>:7272`. Note that before setting up certificates,
the server will run with a self-signed cert. You must allow the browser to bypass the security warning.

Note: First time users use "admin" as Username and Password.

See the
[ManageEngine Password Manager Pro - Getting Started Guide](https://www.manageengine.com/products/passwordmanagerpro/getting-started-guide.html)
for post-installation configuration.

The only step that is absolutely mandatory
is to configure mail server (even if given invalid details).
Without this, it is not possible to add users.

## Uninstalling the Trial

Stop the PMP service:

    sudo systemctl stop pmp.service

Uninstall the system service (I don't know if this might have been handled by the Uninstaller below:

    $ sudo bash pmp.sh install

hmm, removing the trial does not appear to be documented anywhere on their site.
I did see that it installed an `~/Uninstaller` symlink in my file system.
Running it seems to be doing the right thing...

    $ ./Uninstaller

    This will remove features installed by InstallAnywhere.  It will not remove
    files and folders created after the installation.

I chose to "Completely remove all features and components."

    Some items could not be removed.

Say what? Can't find any logs that might tell me what "could not be removed". For good measure I also:

    rm -fR ~/ManageEngine/
