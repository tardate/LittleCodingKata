# #xxx Musicians with Prolog

Using Prolog to represent and query a knowledge base representing musicians and instruments.

## Notes

This is an exercise from [Seven Languages in Seven Weeks](../../books/seven-languages-in-seven-weeks/).

The task:

* Make a knowledge base representing musicians and instruments. Also
represent musicians and their genre of music.
* Find all musicians who play the guitar.

## Thinking about the Problem

This is a fairly straight-forward problem:

* we just need to record facts directly about each musician: the instrument(s) and genre(s)
* we are only making basic and direct queries about the facts

## Implementation

See [musicians.pl](./musicians.pl).
It defines the instrument(s) that a musicians `plays`, and the `genre`.
For example, a small extract:

```prolog
genre(ella_fitzgerald, jazz).
genre(elton_john, pop_rock).
plays(ella_fitzgerald, vocals).
plays(elton_john, piano).
plays(elton_john, vocals).
```
