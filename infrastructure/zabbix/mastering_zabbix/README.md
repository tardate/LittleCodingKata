# #113 Zabbix

Book notes - Mastering Zabbix by Andrea Dalle Vacche, Stefano Kewan Lee, published by PacktPub.

## Notes

I review [Mastering Zabbix](https://subscription.packtpub.com/book/networking_and_servers/9781783283491) many years ago - see my notes below.
There has since been a [Second Edition](https://subscription.packtpub.com/book/networking-and-servers/9781785289262) that I have not read yet.

### Getting the Source

First edition sources are available via the [packtpub portal](https://account.packtpub.com/getfile/9781783283491/code).
I don't have the second edition, and it seems one might need to have subscribed or purchased the book to download
the examples.
