# #113 Mastering Zabbix

Book notes - Mastering Zabbix by Andrea Dalle Vacche, Stefano Kewan Lee, published by PacktPub.

## Notes

I reviewed [Mastering Zabbix](https://amzn.to/480jdvj) many years ago - see my notes below. There has since been a [Second Edition](https://amzn.to/42rpQDl) that I have not read yet.

the examples.
