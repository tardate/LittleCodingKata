# #xxx Deck of Cards

Using the Io language to model a deck of cards; cassidoo's interview question of the week (2025-12-08).

## Notes

The [interview question of the week (2025-12-08)](https://buttondown.com/cassidoo/archive/dont-watch-the-clock-do-what-it-does-keep-going)
asks us to model a deck of cards in code:

> Make a data structure for a deck of cards, and implement a shuffle() method, and a draw(n) method (where you draw n cards). Calling draw() when the deck is empty returns an empty array.
>
> Example usage:
>
> ```ts
> const deck = new Deck();
> deck.shuffle();
> console.log(deck.draw(5)); // Example: ['10♠', 'K♥', '3♣', 'J♦', '7♠']
> console.log(deck.draw(5).length); // 5
> console.log(deck.draw(2)); // Example: ['5♣', 'A♠']
> ```

## Thinking about the Problem

## First Solution

### Example Code

Final code is in [deck.io](./deck.io):

```io
```
