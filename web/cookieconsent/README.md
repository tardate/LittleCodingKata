Using cookieconsent for embedding cookie warnings in a web page

## Notes

Cookie Consent is a free JavaScript plugin for alerting users about the use of cookies.

It is provided as a free open source solution by [osano](https://www.osano.com/cookieconsent/documentation/about-cookie-consent/).
They also have a hosted solution.

### Using the osano generator

Osano provide a [cookieconsent/download](https://www.osano.com/cookieconsent/download/)
wizard to configure the open source library.
i.e. instead of [reading the docs!](https://www.osano.com/cookieconsent/documentation/javascript-api/)

Here's a simple example I made using the generated code - see [example.html](./example.html).
