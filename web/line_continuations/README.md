# #139 Line Continuations in HTML

CSS and Javascript solutions for indicating line continuations in web pages.

## Notes

These solutions were developed thanks to a
[question on stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/330229/how-to-apply-a-line-wrap-continuation-style-and-code-formatting-with-css).

The [example.html](./example.html) demonstrates three approaches:

* Style #1: Line continuation characters at the beginning of the line
* Style #2: Line continuation characters at the end of the line
* Style #3: Using a modified syntaxhighlighter (js) library
