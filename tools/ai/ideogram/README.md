A quick test with a generic prompt:

Quick test with a very specific prompt:

> an Aichi E13A Jake floatplane coming in to land at Deboyne Lagoon. Use an accurate representation of an Aichi E13A. Show the plane at the point it is touching down to land.

Not bad, generated convincing action and environment, but the plane is completely wrong.
