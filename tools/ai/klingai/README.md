> an Aichi E13A Jake floatplane coming in to land at Deboyne Lagoon. Use an accurate representation of an Aichi E13A. Show the plane at the point it is touching down to land.

Even when selecting for "relevance" over "creativity", the AI
does not seem to understand the specifics of the prompt. Or perhaps has not been trained on IJN equipment, or has this content filtered?

It seems to do much better with more generic prompts. For example:

> a sad robot walking down a cyberpunk alleyway in some dystopian future
