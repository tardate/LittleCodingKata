Quick test with a very specific prompt:

> an Aichi E13A Jake floatplane coming in to land at Deboyne Lagoon. Use an accurate representation of an Aichi E13A. Show the plane at the point it is touching down to land.

The result has convincing detail about the action of a float plane coming into land, but the landscape and plane model are totally wrong:
