### Example: Overview of the People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN)

Sources I provided:

* <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Liberation_Army_Navy>
* `PLAN Ships.pdf` - China Files Peoples Liberation Army Navy Ships

It generated this pretty decent audio overview:

The analysis it provided of the sources, with citations, was very impressive and would make learning any new topic so much easier.
