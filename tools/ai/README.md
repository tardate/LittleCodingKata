A collection of AI tools that I've either used or would like to check out at some point.

## Notes

Given how hot the topic of AI is these days, This list will go out of date immediately.
It is not trying to be comprehensive - just a collection of tools I have come across and
either use, or would like to check out at some point.

Even when selecting for "relevance" over "creativity", the AI
does not seem to understand the specifics of the prompt. Or perhaps has not been trained on IJN equipment, or has this content filtered?

It seems to do much better with more generic prompts. For example:

> a sad robot walking down a cyberpunk alleyway in some dystopian future
