# #297 AI Tools

A collection of AI tools that I've either used or would like to check out at some point.

## Notes

Given how hot the topic of AI is these days, this list will go out of date immediately.
It is not trying to be comprehensive - just a collection of tools I have come across and
either use, tried, or would like to check out at some point.

### Developer Tools

* Base44 - see [full review](./base44/)
    > Base44 lets you build fully-functional apps in minutes with just your words. No coding necessary.
* [bolt.new](https://bolt.new/)
    > Prompt, run, edit, and deploy full-stack web apps.
    * suited to freelancers building wide range of app types or prototypes
    > Bolt offers a hybrid experience for technical freelancers or small-scale projects. It provides browser-based full-stack development with easy deployment and a flexible approach for non-technical users like photographers who want to create a quick website or project. It’s perfect for solo entrepreneurs who want to build small but functional apps without the hassle of learning to code deeply.
* [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/)
    > Built to make you extraordinarily productive, Cursor is the best way to code with AI.
    * suited to experienced developers, similar to GitHub Copilot
    > Cursor is made for developers. It assumes you’ve coded before and want to refine your projects with AI assistance. It’s powerful, especially when paired with models like Sonnet 3.5, but you’ll need to handle deployment on your own. Great for JavaScript, Node.js, and full-stack devs who need an AI assistant, not a crutch.
* [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot)
* [make.com](https://www.make.com/)
    > From tasks and workflows to apps and systems, build and automate anything in one powerful visual platform.
* [Pythagora](https://www.pythagora.ai/)
    > Pythagora is a dev tool that builds apps from scratch by talking to you
    * suited to non-technical small-medium business users for building productivity tools
    > Pythagora is ideal for non-developers or small businesses that need reliable, production-ready applications without writing code. Think business apps like accounts receivable software for a trucking company. It simplifies deployment and automated bug fixing but is more rigid compared to others.
* [Replit](https://replit.com/)
    > Build software faster - Replit is an AI-powered software development & deployment platform for building, sharing, and shipping software fast.
    * suited for developing simple apps without any coding experience
    > Replit is perfect for beginners or hobbyists looking to jump into coding fast. It offers a seamless way to build and deploy small apps right from your browser. However, it’s not suited for complex projects—especially when dealing with authentication or debugging tricky errors.

Prompt:

> Kamikawa Maru seaplane tender is at anchor in Deboyne Lagoon. We see the crew winching an Aichi E13A Jake float plan aboard using the ship's crane.

[![clip](https://img.youtube.com/vi/dmdr32KoQ3A/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmdr32KoQ3A)

> an Aichi E13A Jake floatplane coming in to land at Deboyne Lagoon. Use an accurate representation of an Aichi E13A. Show the plane at the point it is touching down to land.

Even when selecting for "relevance" over "creativity", the AI
does not seem to understand the specifics of the prompt. Or perhaps has not been trained on IJN equipment, or has this content filtered?

It seems to do much better with more generic prompts. For example:

> a sad robot walking down a cyberpunk alleyway in some dystopian future
