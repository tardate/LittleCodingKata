# #318 Git Batch Push

Using a batch push technique to overcome 2GB GitHub limits.

## Notes

GitHub has a maximum [2 GB limit](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/troubleshooting-the-2-gb-push-limit) for a single push.

I've usually hit this problem when trying to upload very large repositories for the first time.
An example is the [LittleArduinoProjects archive](https://github.com/tardate/LittleArduinoProjects-archive-2014-2024) (prior to a 10th anniversary squash).

When the size is due to a long history of multiple smaller commits, the general solution is to break up the push into multiple steps - the "batch push".

The problem and solution is [discussed on stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15125862/github-remote-push-pack-size-exceeded) and also covered in
[GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/troubleshooting-the-2-gb-push-limit).

The following demonstrates the problem and a scripted solution.

### The Problem

The [LittleArduinoProjects-archive-2014-2024](https://github.com/tardate/LittleArduinoProjects-archive-2014-2024) repository is an example of one that
exceeds the 3 GB limit.

If I attempt to push it all in one go to a new repository (`example-big-repo-clone`), it fails with the error
`pack exceeds maximum allowed size (2.00 GiB)` error:

    $ git clone git@github.com:tardate/LittleArduinoProjects-archive-2014-2024.git example-big-repo

### Batch Push Solution

There are various approaches to batching. The example I'll use take the relative naÃ¯ve approach:

* count the number of commits
* use [seq](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/seq.1.html) to iterate the commits in batches of BATCH_SIZE (default: 500)
* for each batch:
    * find the commit corresponding to the batch point
    * push up to that specific commit
* push any remaining commits

I've scripted this in [git_batch_push.sh](./git_batch_push.sh). Let's try that push again, this time by batches:

    $ ../git_batch_push.sh clone
    >> remote branch not found. Pushing all commits (HEAD)...
    >> preparing to push     2392 commits to clone/master in batches of 500...
    >> pushing batch 1 : 876f8bf16cd52675fdc022b046b28e6240a31c21...
