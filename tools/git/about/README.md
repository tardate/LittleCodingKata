# #305 about git

A general introduction to git and source control systems.

## Notes

I was first introduced to software version control tools with [cvs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_Versions_System) / [rcs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_Control_System) on Unix, and then struggled with  various systems such as [TLIB](https://www.burtonsys.com/) on OS/2, and [VSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Visual_SourceSafe) on Windows before the era of distributed version control arrived.
I dabbled on occasion with [Mercurial](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/), but the winner has clearly been [git](https://git-scm.com/) .. at this point, the question is more like: "why not git?".

### About Git

Git is a distributed version control system that helps developers track changes to their code, collaborate on projects, and manage different versions of files over time. Created by Linus Torvalds in 2005, Git is popular in software development due to its flexibility, efficiency, and capability to handle both small and large projects.

Some key features of Git:

* Distributed System: Unlike centralized systems, Git allows every developer to have a full copy of the project’s history. This decentralized approach enables offline work and speeds up operations like commits and branching.
* Commit History: Git tracks changes through commits, which record snapshots of the project at specific points. Each commit is uniquely identified by a hash, making it easy to see what changes were made and by whom.
* Branching and Merging: Git’s branching system is lightweight, allowing developers to create separate branches for features, bug fixes, or experiments. Merging these branches back into the main codebase is relatively seamless, making it easier to integrate changes and collaborate effectively.
* Collaboration: With platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket, Git enables teams to work together more efficiently. These platforms add features like pull requests, issue tracking, and continuous integration, which streamline the development workflow.

Git is command-line-based, but many graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and integrations with code editors are available to simplify usage.
