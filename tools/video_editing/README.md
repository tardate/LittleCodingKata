Miscellaneous video editing and manipulation tools

## Notes

### ezgif

[ezgif](https://ezgif.com) has a range of free-to-use image and video manipulation tools.
They have a limit on file size and do not host the resulting file.

Seems legit - I've used it for a few quick video croping and resizing tasks.
