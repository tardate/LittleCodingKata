# MacOSX Cheatsheet

A place to record some of my favourite MacOSX tools, tips and tricks.


## Digital Color Meter

[Digital Color Meter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Color_Meter) is a utility provided in MacOSX that can be
used to easily ready the pixel color from anywhere on the screen.
Great for quickly color matching.
