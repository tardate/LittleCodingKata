A place to record some of my favourite MacOS tools, tips and tricks.


## Digital Color Meter

[Digital Color Meter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Color_Meter) is a utility provided in MacOS that can be
used to easily ready the pixel color from anywhere on the screen.
Great for quickly color matching.

## How to retrieve windows that have moved 'off-screen'

Occasionally I seem to be able to move a window entirely off-screen, especially when connecting an external monitor.

Hold the Option key down and choose "Arrange in Front" from the Window menu.
It will then arrange all the windows of that application in a cascade from the top left of the screen.
