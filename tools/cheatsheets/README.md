# #332 Cheat Sheets for Developers

The ultimate repository of sheets and quick references meticulously crafted by the open community boost your productivity

## Notes

I recently stumbled upon <https://cheatsheets.zip/>.

It is a wonderful collection of reference guides, maintained in the open on GitHub: <https://github.com/Fechin/reference>.

Entries are maintained with simple markdown format, and rendered with
[hexo](https://github.com/hexojs/hexo) - a fast, simple & powerful blog framework, powered by Node.js.

Note: there is a version of this project hosted on `quickref.me`, but apparently that is no longer maintained by the project. The domain was sold to a US company and the project is now primarily hosted on <https://cheatsheets.zip/>. Yes, a little bit sus... seems like the new `quickref.me` owner is using it to earn ad revenue at least, and hopefully not trying to inject anything malicious at the same time.
