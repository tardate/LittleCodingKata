# Finding Python Libraries

How to find great python libraries and resources.


## Notes

### Finding Libraries

My personal preference:

Check the [awesome-python](https://github.com/vinta/awesome-python) list.
It's a curated collection, so may be the fastest way to find the most well-known solutions for common needs.

For less common requirements, searching [PyPI - the Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi) may identify candidates.

Otherwise, Google is your friend..
