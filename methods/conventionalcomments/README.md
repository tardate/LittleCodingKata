# #xxx conventional: comments

A way to write comments that are easy to grok and grep.

## Notes

[Conventional Comments](https://conventionalcomments.org/) was created by Paul Slaughter (who worked at GitLab) as a lightweight convention for structuring review/feedback comments (code reviews, editing feedback, pull/merge requests) with clear labels and intent.

The basic format is:

```text
<label> [decorations]: <subject>

[discussion]
```

Where for example:

* `label` could be: fix, feat etc
* optional  `decorations` could be (blocking), (non-blocking) etc

Status?

* the idea has been adopted or at least considered by many teams
* several browser extensions and tools exist to support Conventional Comments
