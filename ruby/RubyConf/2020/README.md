## Workshops

### Parrot Emergency! Planning Reliable, Maintainable Software

Your team is writing an app for a parrot emergency room. The system tracks birds' vital signs, patient histories, and breed guidelines to prioritize their care and notify vets immediately in an emergency.

This system needs to work—parrots' lives are on the line! What will you do to plan a reliable, maintainable software system from the outset?

In this workshop, you'll work with a group to:

* Identify technical risks in the system
* Quantify and prioritize the risks
* Choose preventive measures and countermeasures to mitigate the risks
* Go home with new toolsets to write your own trustworthy code!

### Improve Your Technical Writing

It's great to be able to write clear code. Being able to write clear prose is also an important skill for a developer. Developers communicate with their teams using the written word. Improving your writing skills will help you explain requirements to your team, improve the quality of your code review, and make all of your communication clearer. This workshop will cover specific issues of technical writing, and give concrete tips for improving and practicing your skills. Over the course of the workshop, attendees will create a piece of narrative documentation of their choosing.
