# Installing elm

## Notes

Perhaps one day elm will come with your browser, but for now
there are basically three methods for installing elm:

* binary distributions - Mac and Windows
* nms package
* build from source

I'll try my first tests using npm.

### Installing with npm

For routing use, [it is recommended to install elm globally](https://www.npmjs.com/package/elm):

    npm install -g elm

For a first test though, I'm going to install locally - even though elm does warn not to!

#### Initial package.json setup

    npm init
    npm install elm --save-dev

#### Install from package.json

    npm install

Put the local node_packages bin directory on the path. Hopefully this should get around
any problems with this not being a global install:

    export PATH=$(npm bin):$PATH

So far so good:

    $ elm
    Elm Platform 0.16.0 - a way to run all Elm tools

    Usage: elm <command> [<args>]

    Available commands include:

    make      Compile an Elm file or project into JS or HTML
    package   Manage packages from <http://package.elm-lang.org>
    reactor   Develop with compile-on-refresh and time-travel debugging
    repl      A REPL for running individual expressions

    You can learn more about a specific command by running things like:

    elm make --help
    elm package --help
    elm <command> --help

    In all these cases we are simply running 'elm-<command>' so if you create an
    executable named 'elm-foobar' you will be able to run it as 'elm foobar' as
    long as it appears on your PATH.

### Quick REPL Test

Elm has a REPL package for testing snippets interactively.

    $ elm repl
    ---- elm repl 0.16.0 -----------------------------------------------------------
    :help for help, :exit to exit, more at <https://github.com/elm-lang/elm-repl>
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    > 1 + 1
    2 : number
    > f n = n + 1
    <function> : number -> number
    > f 41
    42 : number
    > :exit

### Going Global

OK, now that seems to be all working OK, I went ahead and installed globally:

    npm install -g elm
