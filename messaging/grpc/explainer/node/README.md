# #021 gRPC Explainer - Node.js version

This sample implements a Node.js client and server that talk the
[Explainer Protocol](../protocols/explainer.proto).

The Explainer is totally inspired by Natalie Silvanovich's
[Hardware Excuse Generator](http://natashenka.ca/hardware-excuse-generator/)

## Installation

Node doesn't need protocol compilation, so setup is as simple as installing the grpc module.
The module and other dependencies are in `package.json`, so install as usual:

```
$ npm install
```

## Test Drive - Node.js Client

I don't have a node.js server yet, so using the [ruby version](../ruby)
Start the server in one console window..

```
$ cd ../ruby
$ ./explainer.rb
ShiFu is waiting to explain all of your problems...

```

Now try the node.js client in another:

```
$ node ./explain.js

Here's some help:

Describe your problem in a sentence, using the text "REASON" where-ever you'd like a good excuse inserted

e.g. "Glitching was not a viable attack because of REASON"

$ node ./explain.js "Your laptop is crashing because of REASON"
Your laptop is crashing because of a lack of shielding against alpha radiation (cosmic rays) in antenna
```
