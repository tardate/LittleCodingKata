# #017 - The Explainer

My first experiment with gRPC and various language bindings.

## The Explainer Protocol

The Explainer is totally inspired by Natalie Silvanovich's
[Hardware Excuse Generator](http://natashenka.ca/hardware-excuse-generator/)

These examples implement clients and servers in various languages
that talk the
[Explainer Protocol](./protocols/explainer.proto).

And they should inter-operate! Let's see..

## Language Bindings and Examples

* [C++](./cpp) - client
* [C#](./csharp) - client
* [Node.js](./node) - client
* [Python](./python) - client
* [Ruby](./ruby) - client and server
