# #082 D3 Basics

Getting up and running and understanding the latest in D3.js

## Notes

D3.js is a JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data.

Positives:

* pretty unbounded capabilities
* well documented API
* not available via CDN and for offline/stand-alone packaging and distribution

Negatives:

* quite complicated to do simple things
* steep learning curve: lack of examples and getting started guides
* version differences can impair learning (most published resources are for older versions)
