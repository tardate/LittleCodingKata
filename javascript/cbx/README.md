# Cross-browser X Library

Playing with the old inner solar system demo for the cross-browser javascript X library.

## Notes

I can't recall when I first checked out the X library [cross-browser.com](http://cross-browser.com/) but it must have been
back in the prototype/scriptaculous days.

The last release of the library was X 4.23 from 14-May-2011, and I suspect was subsequently eclipsed by the rise of the jQuery ecosystem.
The X library has some really advanced capabilities that it is a pity never went any further, but the coding paradigm
of the X library was perhaps just not as coherent as the jQuery approach.

About the X library:

> X is a collection of loosely-bound, cross-browser, Javascript functions and objects. It is intended to be a resource from which you pick and choose - you do not have to include the entire library in your application. It contains core DOM/Style functions, unobtrusive enhancements, utility functions, objects such as menus and tab panels, and also has some experimental stuff.

### Inner Solar System Demo

The [inner_solar_system.html](./inner_solar_system.html) demo remains one of the most popular, despite using an earlier version of the X library.
As of 2020, it still runs jsut fine in the latest Chrome and Firefox browsers.
