  LittleCodingKata is my collection of programming exercises, research and code toys broadly spanning things that relate to programming and software development
  (languages, frameworks and tools).
</p>
<p>
  These range from the trivial to the complex and serious. Many are inspired by existing work and I'll note credits and references where applicable.
  The focus is quite scattered, as I variously work on things new and important in the moment, or go back to revisit things from the past.

<p>
  This is primarily a personal collection for my own edification and learning, but anyone who stumbles by is welcome to borrow, steal or reference the work here.
  And if you spot errors or issues I'd really appreciate some feedback - create an issue, send me an email or even send a pull-request.
