About STUBS
===========
Most developers have a pretty clear idea about how they like their
source files organized. You may follow the more common conventions,
or use a style of your own. Either way, you don't want to be typing
all the same fluff for each new file created.

The most common solution to this problem is to keep a selection of
templates. Rather than type a header, copyright info and so on - just
copy the template and away you go. Two things could be improved though:
you may end up with a clutter of templates, and the template may still
need a bit of tweaking on a case-by-case basis.

STUBS.CMD allows you to automate your use of templates ("stubs").
Running STUBS first presents you with a menu from which you can select
the template to be generated. After providing a new filename, the
script generates a file based on the selected template. Of course,
being a REXX script it can include all kinds of smarts when generating
the template - such as including a copyright notice with this years
date (instead of the date from when you created the template;-).

So far its a good concept - but you may ask how I (as the guy who
wrote STUBS.CMD) know how you want your templates produced. The answer
is - I don't! In fact, STUBS.CMD comes as a basic menu shell but
contains no actual templates. The one useful command it provides you
(other than "exit") is "modify".

The "MODIFY" command allows you to add a new template to STUBS.CMD.
You provide an example file, and the script reads it in, creating the
necessary procedures and code modifications in STUBS.CMD to support
the new template type. The code to write the new templates is
encapsulated in procedures which are simply appended to the file.

When adding a new template, you are asked for three bits of
information: the filename of the file to be used as the example
template; the keyword to be used as the menu command; and a
description of the template - this is used in the menu display.

How to best use STUBS? I suggest that you marshal your most commonly
used templates and put a bit of effort into cleaning them up. Once
they've checked out OK, use the MODIFY command to add them to STUBS.

By this stage, STUBS.CMD will be a self-contained script that can
re-create your original templates on command. You can stop right
there, however you may wish to delve in and customize the
template-writing procedures to add extra capabilities (Such as
date-stamping the files on creation).
