## Notes

[REXX, The Developer's Best Friend](https://www.edm2.com/0303/rexx.html) - a quick look at REXX, the Bassett hound of programming languages.

This article was published in EDM/2 The Electronic Developer Magazine for OS/2, March 1995, Volume 3 Issue 3.

Recording it here for posterity!

In retrospect, REXX really was a clunky scripting language, hobbled by mainframe and DOS-isms that we gladly do without these days!

## The Scripts

* [INFICONS.CMD](./scripts/INFICONS.CMD)
    * search for INF files on disk, and create icons for them in a folder
* [LINE.CMD](./scripts/LINE.CMD)
    * prints the specified line number of a file to the screen
* [NEWPROJ.CMD](./scripts/LINE.CMD)
    * new project setup from template
* [QUOTE.CMD](./scripts/LINE.CMD)
    * formats lines for inclusion in C/C++ or REXX procedures.
* [STUBS.CMD](./scripts/LINE.CMD)
    * Program Code Stub Creation
* [TAIL.CMD](./scripts/LINE.CMD)
    * prints the last 'x' lines of a text file to the screen.
